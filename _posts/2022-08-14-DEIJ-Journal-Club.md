**Background**
<br>
A group of scientists within the Fraser lab have begun a journal club centered around issues of diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice within academia, specifically in the biological sciences.

Our goal is to provide an environment for continued learning, critical discussion, and brainstorming action items that individuals and labs can implement. Our discussions and proposed interventions reflect our own opinions based on our personal identities and lived experiences, and may differ from the identities and experiences of others. We will recap our discussions and proposed action items through a series of blog posts, and encourage readers to directly engage with DEIJ practitioners and their scholarship to improve your environment.


**August 19th, 2022 - Peer Review**

**Discussion Leader:** [Roberto Efraín (Robbie) Díaz](/members/#Roberto%20Efraín%20(Robbie)%20Díaz)

**Article:** Unprofessional Peer Reviews Disproportionately Harm Underrepresented Groups in STEM. Silbiger NJ, & Stubler AD (2019) DOI: [10.1080/03626784.2018.1468211](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03626784.2018.1468211)

**Summary**
The authors conducted a broad survey of STEM workers who have submitted first-author publications to study the prevalence and impact of unprofessional reviews (defined here as those either focused on the author or unnecessarily cruel and unconstructive) on the self-evaluation and productivity of recipients. A total of 1,106 responses to the survey were analyzed, along with self-reported identities and impacts on confidence, productivity, and career advancement. The authors also examined the potential compounding effect of intersectional identities during their analysis.

**Key Points**
- The majority of respondents (58%) reported receiving reviews that were unprofessional, with some frankly unacceptable comments included for examples (Figure 1).
- The rate at which they were received did not appear to vary across identity groups, but the impacts on self-evaluation, productivity and career advancement were significantly higher for men of color, white women and women of color, and white non-binary people and non-binary people of color.
- Women of color and non-binary people of color reported the largest effects, emphasizing the relevance of intersectional identities

**Open Questions**
- Is there value in maintaining completely unfiltered reviews, or do editors have a role in removing content?
- Should unprofessional review be a cause for sanctions?
- Should professional review be rewarded? If yes, what mechanisms could do so?
- Would more open review decrease the prevalence of unprofessional review, and if so, what interventions are needed to protect learners from retaliation if they participate in it?
- How might we shift peer review from journal-specific, with the attendant gatekeeping role, to manuscript-specific?

**Proposed Action Items**
- Make public review opt-out for senior scientists. While there still may be legitimate concerns about retaliation and power differentials even for established researchers, we suggest that making reviewers public as the default (with generous provisions to opt out) could decrease abuse.
- Journals and editors should provide clear guidelines for professional conduct and sanction those who fail to abide by them. We believe there is a clear distinction between negative review which is ultimately constructive and comments which deride work based on personal attributes or identities. Review is both a service to the field and a privilege: those who use it to abuse others should not be rewarded with further assignments.
- Recognize quality review. Review, as service, is often undervalued. A mechanism to elicit feedback from editors on the quality of a reviewer's work would maintain anonymity, support and encourage quality review, and discourage cruelty.
