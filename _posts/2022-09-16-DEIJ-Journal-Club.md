**Background**
<br>
A group of scientists within the Fraser lab have begun a journal club centered around issues of diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice within academia, specifically in the biological sciences.

Our goal is to provide an environment for continued learning, critical discussion, and brainstorming action items that individuals and labs can implement. Our discussions and proposed interventions reflect our own opinions based on our personal identities and lived experiences, and may differ from the identities and experiences of others. We will recap our discussions and proposed action items through a series of blog posts, and encourage readers to directly engage with DEIJ practitioners and their scholarship to improve your environment.

<!-- **Summary:**


**Key Points:**


**Open Questions:**
- What interventions are needed to protect learners from retaliation if they participate in open peer review?
- What role, if any, does the editor have in filtering and sanctioning peer review comments?
- How do we reward reviewers for their service?
- How do we shift peer review from being journal-specific to manuscript-specific?
